Lotsos' Tips for WebApp Dev

So yeah basically you're looking at two paths
1) the "full-stack" dev who focuses more on back-end stuff like programming web servers with node or an equivalent Python framework (Django for opinionated and flask otherwise afaik) and has a working knowledge of front end, enough to serve up pages that are usually styled via a framework like Bootstrap or Bulma
2) the "full-stack" developer who would act more like a JavaScript engineer (see something like a MERN stack programmer) where youd learn react to build web apps with
The former is the path that most older web developers took/take because its based on a simpler, easier to grasp web dev model
The latter is more new-school, specialized, and considered a fast track to a job but in my experience confuses anyone and everyone who tries it LOL

https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/
flask is a simple framework to get started with webserver programming
Essentially, a web server is a program that runs on a dedicated computer, on a specific port, that listens for requests and executes code based on different requests it receives
If the up address of the server is X then going to the url "X:5000/" using a browser would mean that you're making a get request to port 5000 of the server and you're requesting the path "/"

Learn how to:

Set up a dev server on your computer with flask
Do your python magic to get your data and transform it
Dabble into creating your own apis for a little but don't get too sidetracked
Serve your transformed data in basic HTML/CSS pages that are styled with bootstrap

Bootstrap on the frontend, flask on the webserver and MySQL or openSQL should get you pretty far in understanding the concepts of web dev
